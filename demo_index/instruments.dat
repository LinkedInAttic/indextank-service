S'The term requinto is used in both Spanish and Portuguese to mean a smaller, higher-pitched version of another instrument.

S'The kora is a 21-string bridge-harp used extensively by people in West Africa.\nA kora is built from a large calabash cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator, and has a notched bridge like a lute or guitar. It does not fit well into any one category of western instruments and would have to be described as a double bridge harp lute. The sound of a kora resembles that of a harp, though when played in the traditional style, it bears a closer resemblance to flamenco and delta...'

Slightly larger than the oboe, it has a less assertive and more tranquil and serene tone, and is considered the mezzo-soprano of the oboe family, between the oboe itself (soprano) and the cor anglais, or English horn (alto). It is a transposing instrument, sounding a minor third lower than it is notated, i.e. in A. The bell is pear-shaped and the instrument..."

It can also refer to a violin fitted with an electric pickup of some type, although "amplified violin" or "electro-acoustic violin" are more accurate in that case.\nElectrically amplified violins have been used in one form or another since the 1920s; jazz and blues artist Stuff Smith is...'

S'The treble flute is a member of the flute family. It is in the key of G, pitched a fifth above the concert flute and is a transposing instrument, sounding a fifth up from the written note. The instrument is rare today, only occasionally found in flute choirs, some marching bands or private collections. Some 19th century operas, such as Ivanhoe include the instrument in their orchestrations.\nA limited number of manufacturers produce G treble flute, including Myall-Allen and Flutemakers Guild....'

This is not the same as an electric acoustic guitar, which is an acoustic guitar with the addition of pickups or other means of amplification, either added by the manufacturer or the player.\nOther semi-acoustic or acoustic electric instruments include basses and mandolins.

It consists of a thin wooden blade fixed in a wooden block (often attached to a tripod), which holds one or more contact microphones. Normally, it is played by bowing the free end, but it can also be struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by...'

It produces sound by plucking a string when a key is pressed.\nIn the narrow sense, "harpsichord" designates only the large wing-shaped instruments in which the strings are perpendicular to the keyboard. In a broader sense, "harpsichord" designates the whole family of similar plucked keyboard instruments, including the smaller virginals, muselar, and spinet.\nThe harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque music....'

S'The Messiah-Salabue Stradivarius of 1716 is a violin made by Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari of Cremona.\nThe Messiah, sobriquet Le Messie, remained in the Stradivarius workshop until his death in 1737. It was then sold by his son Paolo to Count Cozio di Salabue in 1775, and for a time, the violin bore the name Salabue. The instrument was then purchased by Luigi Tarisio in 1827. Upon Tarisio\xe2\x80\x99s death, in 1854, French luthier Jean Baptiste Vuillaume of Paris purchased The Messiah along with...'

S'A brass instrument is a musical instrument whose sound is produced by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player\'s lips. Brass instruments are also called labrosones, literally meaning "lip-vibrated instruments".\nThere are several factors involved in producing different pitches on a brass instrument: One is alteration of the player\'s lip tension (or "embouchure"), and another is air flow. Also, slides (or valves) are used to change the...'

S'A portative organ (portatif organ, portativ organ, or simply portative, portatif, or portativ) (from the Latin verb portare, "to carry") is a small pipe organ that consists of one rank of flue pipes and played while strapped to the performer at a right angle.

Among the first companies to produce them were Stromberg-Voisinet, Electro (which later became Rickenbacker), ViViTone, and National Reso-Phonic. Gibson and Vega introduced their electric mandolins in 1936.\nIn the United...'

It is a long zither similar to the guzheng but bowed by scraping with a sorghum stem dusted with resin, a bamboo stick, or a piece of forsythia wood. The musical instrument was popular in the Tang Dynasty, but is today little used except in the folk music of some parts of northern China, where it is called yaqin (simplified: \xe8\xbd\xa7\xe7\x90\xb4; traditional: \xe8\xbb\x8b\xe7\x90\xb4).\nThe Korean ajaeng...'
