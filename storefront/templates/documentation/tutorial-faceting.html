<h2 id="about">About Faceting</h2>
<p>
To make it easier for users to quickly spot the most relevant search results, add faceting functionality. 
With <i>faceting</i>, search results are grouped under useful headings, using tags you apply ahead of time to the documents in 
your index. For example, the results of a shopping query for books might be grouped according to the type of book and the price:
</p>
<div class="facets">
<table>
<tr>
  <th>NARROW YOUR RESULTS BY:</th>
</tr>
</table>
<table>
<tr>
  <th><b>Most popular</b></th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Top rated (5)
        </li>
        <li>
          "Very Good" (25)
        </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>Content</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Cookbooks (10)
        </li>
        <li>
          Romance (15)
        </li>
        <li>
          Science Fiction (13)
        </li>
        <li>
          Travel (30)
        </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>Price</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Less than $10 (5)
        </li>
        <li>
          $10-$19.99 (200)
        </li>
        <li>
          $20-$29.99 (140)
        </li>
        <li>
          $30 and up (46)
        </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
Each time the user clicks a facet value, the set of results is reduced to only the items that have that value.
Additional clicks continue to narrow down the search—the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
For example, the user might click "Cookbooks," and see a list of all 10 cookbook titles next to an updated navigation
list like this:
</p>

<div class="facets">
<table>
<tr>
  <th>NARROW YOUR RESULTS BY:</th>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
  <th><b>Most popular</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Top rated (1)
        </li>
        <li>
          "Very Good" (3)
        </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th><b>Price</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Less than $10 (1)
        </li>
        <li>
          $10-$19.99 (4)
        </li>
        <li>
          $20-$29.99 (4)
        </li>
        <li>
          $30 and up (1)
        </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
If price is more important to the user than the reviews of fellow shoppers, the next 
click would be on a price range, say "$10-19.99." Now the list might look like this:
</p>

<div class="facets">
<table>
<tr>
  <th>NARROW YOUR RESULTS BY:</th>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
  <th><b>Most popular</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <ul>
        <li>
          "Very Good" (1)
        </li>
    </ul>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
    At this point, it is very easy for the user to choose the right cookbook.
</p>
<h3>Why Use Faceting?</h3>
<p>Faceted search results provide an easy-to-scan, browsable display that helps users quickly narrow down each search.
The faceting tags that you store with your IndexTank documents provide a way to add your own taxonomy to directly control
the presentation of search results. In the end, it's about helping the user find the right information.
Faceted search gives a user the power to create an individualized navigation path, drilling down through successive 
refinements to reach the right document. This more effectively mirrors the intuitive thought patterns of most users.
Faceted search has become an expected feature, particularly for commerce sites.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Faceted search is performed in several parts:
<ul>
    <li>
    <b>Index:</b> to each document in the index, add tags to specify a value for each facet. For example, 
    for each book in the index, tag it with the type of material and the price range.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Search results:</b> for every search, the IndexTank server returns a count of how many matching documents were 
        tagged with each value within each facet. For example, if the query was for "books," you might find out that in the 
        facet "type of material," your index contains 13 science fiction books, 15 romance novels, and 10 cookbooks; and in 
        the price facet, there are 5 books under $10, 200 books from $10-19.99, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Query:</b> you can include facet values as query criteria. For example, you can write a query that returns only 
        the romance novels under $10.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Web page:</b> use the facets and document counts returned by the server to create a set of facet links on your web page, 
        like the example shown above. Then construct queries to be activated by each facet link, passing in the appropriate values—say, 
        querying only for romance novels when the user clicks the "Romance (15)" link.
    </li>
    
</ul>

        The tags applied to documents need not be the same strings that you will display to users.

    Store the facets and facet values as metadata by adding tags to documents in your index.
</p>
<p>
    The following code shows how to tag a document with several facets at the same time, using 
    the updateCategories() method from the Java client library:
</p>
{% box 'code' %}
<pre class="content1 sh_ruby" style="display:block;">
categories = { 
                  'priceRange' => '$10-$19.99',
                  'bookType' => 'cookbook'
             }

index.document(docid).update_categories(categories) 
</pre>
<pre class="content2 sh_python" style="display:none;">
categories = { 
                  'priceRange': '$10-$19.99',
                  'bookType': 'cookbook'
             }

index.update_categories(docid, categories) 
</pre>
<pre class="content3 sh_php" style="display:none;">
categories = array('priceRange' => '$10-$19.99',
                   'bookType' => 'cookbook');

$index->update_categories($docid, $categories); 
</pre>
<pre class="content4 sh_java" style="display:none;">
Map&lt;String, String&gt; categories = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
categories.put("priceRange", "$10-$19.99");
categories.put("bookType", "cookbook");

index.updateCategories(docId, categories);
</pre>
{% endbox %}


<h3>See Facets in Query Results</h3>
<p>
    After you have tagged documents, the IndexTank server will start to show 
    faceting data in the results it returns for search requests. For example, 
    if you search for books about France, you might get results like the following:
</p>

{% box 'code' %}
<pre class="sh_java">
{
   'bookType': {
       'cookbook': 2,
       'travel': 4
   },
   'priceRange': {
       'Less than $10': 1,
       '$10-$19.99': 5
   }
}
</pre>
{% endbox %}
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>
    This shows that there are both cookbooks and travel books related to France, and most of them are between $10 and $20.
</p>

<h3>Use Facets as Query Criteria</h3>

<p>
    You can filter a search by using facet values. This is similar to using document variables, 
    but uses different syntax. For example, suppose you want to find cookbooks that cost less 
    than $20.00. The following code shows how to do that search by using .withCategoryFilters 
    to include facet values in a query:
</p>

{% box 'code' %}
<pre class="content1 sh_ruby" style="display:block;">
index.search(query,
             :category_filters => {
                'priceRange' => ['Less than $10', '$10-$19.99'],
                'bookType' => ['cookBook']
             })
</pre>
<pre class="content2 sh_python" style="display:none;">
index.search(query,
             category_filters={
                'priceRange': ['Less than $10', '$10-$19.99'],
                'bookType': ['cookBook']
             })
</pre>
<pre class="content3 sh_php" style="display:none;">
$index.search($query, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
             array('priceRange' => array('Less than $10', '$10-$19.99'),
                   'bookType' => array('cookBook'))
             );
</pre>
<pre class="content4 sh_java" style="display:none;">
Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; filters =
       new HashMap&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
filters.put("priceRange",
           Arrays.asList("Less than $10", "$10-$19.99"));
filters.put("bookType",
           Arrays.asList("cookbook"));

results = index.search(Query.forString(query)
                       .withCategoryFilters(filters));
</pre>
{% endbox %}

<h2 id="design">Designing a Faceting Taxonomy</h2>

<p>
    Before you start implementing faceting, take some time to decide on which facets and values make sense for your index.
    When you consider how to categorize information, all sorts of interesting questions can arise. Depending on the size of 
    your index and whether you are working in a large enterprise, you might need to hold a few meetings involving key people
    such as website designers, product managers, information architects, and others.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of your design phase is to arrive at a scheme, probably a written list, that defines the facets and their values.
    For example, suppose you are dealing with the books database from our earlier example. If you decide that one facet is 
    "type of book," what are the book types you want to feature? You'll need to answer questions like these:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Will you base the list on which types are most numerous in your index, on which types people most often purchase,
            or on some other criteria?
        </li>
        <li>
            How many book types do you want to tag before grouping the remaining books into an "Other" category?
        </li>
        <li>
            At what cutoff point does a type of book fall into "Other": if there are fewer than 100 books of that type in the
            index ... fewer than 10 ... or fewer than 10 purchased in the past quarter?
        </li>
        <li>
            Do you want to keep the book type groups fairly even in size? For example, if you have 100 mystery novels and only
            a few books of every other type, do you want to break down the "mystery" group into smaller sub-groups, such as "Noir," "Thriller," and "Sherlock Holmes"?
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    From this example, you can see that a taxonomy can be both complex and dynamic—the design might need to change over time to
    reflect changes in index contents, business goals, and sales fluctuations.
